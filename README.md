# News Article Natural Language Dataset Project

## Structure of the Repo

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Within the [News Data Set EDA notebook](https://github.com/cpuglis1/ProbStoch-I-Project/blob/main/News%20Data%20Set%20EDA.ipynb), the news article headline and descriptions are cleaned, processed, and lemmatized following NLP standards. The data is further explored with sentiment analysis, term-frequency word clouds, topic distributions, and TF-IDF category topic analysis. 

### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Dynamic Topic Modeling (DTM) Hidden Topic Exploration
Within the LDA DTM notebook, LDA and DTM are performed on article headlines to identify hidden topics. Model results are returned and quantified using perplexity and coherence. For a complete write-up analysis, justification for model choices, a dive into the probabilistic theory, and more robust results analysis, please refer to the write up "Bayesian Topic Modeling of News Articles."

### News Article Classifcation
Within the Linear SVC, Logisitic Regression, and Shallow Neural Net classifier notebooks, classification is performed on the news articles. The results ended up beyond the scope of the write up and were not included in said paper.
